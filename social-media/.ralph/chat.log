[2026-02-21 22:37:09] [CRITIC] CRITIC ASSESSMENT COMPLETE | Milestone 0.1: ✅ 70/70 (100%) | Stub detector: 0 findings | Remaining: 4 Angular services use local mock data (share.service.ts, follow.service.ts, activity.service.ts, trending-hashtags) instead of backend API | Build: PASS, Tests: PASS | Recommendation: Create new milestone 'Complete API Integration' under Phase-2 for connecting remaining services to Go backend | See .critic-report.md for details
[2026-02-21 22:37:31] [CRITIC] DETAILED FINDINGS: Milestone 0.1 ✅ COMPLETE (70/70 stubs removed). HOWEVER: Angular services (share.service.ts, follow.service.ts, activity.service.ts) have initializeMockData() in constructors - they simulate API calls with setTimeout but never call backend. These services should call Go backend APIs: POST/GET /api/v1/shares, GET /api/v1/follows, GET /api/v1/activities. Backend endpoints may not exist yet. RECOMMENDATION: Create new PRD items under Phase-2 milestones for backend API implementation + frontend integration. Build: PASS, Go tests: PASS, Angular tests: limited coverage.
