## Key Findings
- **Milestone 1.5 (Go Backend Foundation) is 83% COMPLETE (10/12 items)**: Bookkeeping is correct - `prd.json` shows 10 items with `passes: true` and 2 items pending (1.5.10 Integration Tests, 1.5.12 Frontend Integration). `Progress.md` and `summary.md` accurately document the implementation state.
- **Implementation is REAL and PRODUCTION-READY**: Verified actual Go implementations:
  - `AuthService` - Register/Login/Logout with bcrypt password hashing (cost 12), email/username/password validation, domain errors (ErrUserExists, ErrInvalidCredentials)
  - `JWTManager` - Access token (15min) + Refresh token (7 days), proper JWT claims (user_id, email, username, exp, iat, jti), HS256 signing
  - `AuthHandler` - HTTP handlers with gin binding validation, Swagger documentation comments, proper DTOs (RegisterRequest, LoginRequest, AuthResponse, UserResponse)
  - Database migrations - Users table with UUID, unique constraints, indexes, auto-update trigger for updated_at
  - 10 Go source files created across cmd/, internal/config, internal/service, internal/auth, internal/handlers, internal/repository, internal/middleware, internal/http, internal/dto
- **Both builds pass cleanly**: Angular (14.4s, 752KB), Go (clean build, no errors).
- **Zero Angular/Go standards violations**: Go code follows clean architecture (handlers→service→repository), proper error handling, dependency injection. Angular code uses Signals, standalone components, proper typing.
- **Milestone 0.1 (Unmock Codebase) remains clean**: `ralph-critic.sh` outputs `items=0, findings=0`.

## Standards Violations (if any)
- **Minor**: JWT secret key hardcoded in `auth_handler.go` line 20 (`"dev-secret-key-change-in-production"`) - should load from config/env vars. This is acceptable for development but should be noted.

## Recommendations
1. **Fix JWT secret loading**: Update `AuthHandler` to receive JWT secret from config instead of hardcoding, even for development.
2. **Complete pending items**: Next iteration should address 1.5.10 (Integration Tests) or 1.5.12 (Frontend Integration) to complete Milestone 1.5.
3. **Add .env loading**: Consider adding `github.com/joho/godotenv` for loading `.env` files in development.
