## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **C.011** - Improve critic scanner (meta-task, ensures future scans are accurate)
2. **C.010** - Add HTTP client module (infrastructure needed by frontend services)
3. **C.012** - Create backend API endpoints (infrastructure needed by frontend services)
4. **C.001** through **C.005** - Frontend service integrations (depend on C.010, C.012)
5. **C.006** through **C.009** - Backend improvements (can be done in parallel)
