# Milestone 0.1 - Unmock Codebase

## Problem Statement
The codebase contains mocked/stubbed implementations and TODO-style markers that block production readiness and hide missing functionality.

## Source
Generated by `./ralph-critic.sh`.

## Rules
- Implement exactly one PRD item per iteration.
- Do required bookkeeping: update Progress.md and mark passes=true in prd.json.
