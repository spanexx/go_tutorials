# Milestone 5.4 - Angular Frontend Unit Tests - Services & Guards - Summary

## Status: 🚧 IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Angular services and guards unit testing with HttpClient mocking to verify state management, API communication, and route protection.

## Deliverables

### Planned
- All service unit tests with HttpTestingController
- Route guards (authGuard, guestGuard) tests
- ToastService notification tests

## Architecture Decisions
1. **HttpTestingController**: Angular HTTP client mocking
2. **TestBed**: Angular dependency injection testing
3. **Marble testing**: For Observable timing

## Testing Notes
Coverage target: >= 80%

## Handoff Notes
Service tests ensure frontend business logic correctness and API integration.
